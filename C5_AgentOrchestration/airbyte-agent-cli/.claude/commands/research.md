# Research Codebase

<!-- ultrathink -->

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the `airbyte-agent` CLI codebase to answer the user's question by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.

## Research Question

<research-question>
$ARGUMENTS
</research-question>

## Critical Constraint

YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT AND EXPLAIN THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS TODAY:
- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless explicitly asked
- DO NOT propose future enhancements
- DO NOT critique the implementation
- DO NOT recommend refactoring
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact

## Research Process

### Step 0: Check Existing Research Index

Before spawning subagents, do a quick reuse check:

1. List existing research files: `ls -t thoughts/shared/research/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5`
2. Match the question against the filename/title of each entry
3. If 1-2 entries are clearly relevant, read those docs first and treat them as prior context

When prior docs are used:
- Include their key findings in subagent prompts so agents can verify and extend instead of repeating work
- Treat older docs as potentially stale and explicitly re-validate file paths/behavior during this run

### Step 0.5: Branch Freshness Check (Non-Mutating)

Before spawning research agents, ensure you're aware of upstream changes:

```bash
git fetch origin main 2>/dev/null
BRANCH_HEAD=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
ORIGIN_MAIN=$(git rev-parse origin/main 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
BEHIND_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
echo "Branch HEAD: $BRANCH_HEAD"
echo "origin/main: $ORIGIN_MAIN"
echo "Commits behind main: $BEHIND_COUNT"
```

If `BEHIND_COUNT` is greater than 0, warn: "This branch is **$BEHIND_COUNT commits behind main**. Research findings may not reflect the latest code on main. Consider rebasing before acting on these results."

This is a warning only — do not rebase or modify the branch. Record both SHAs under a `## Provenance` section of the research doc.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Detect Domain

Break down the research question into:
- Specific components to investigate
- Patterns or concepts to find
- Directories likely to contain relevant code

**Detect the domain** of the research question to shape the deep-dive agent:

| Signal | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| References `Resource`, `Operation`, `Register`, command surface, adding commands | **Resources** (`internal/resources/`) |
| References `registry.Build`, Cobra flag generation, `--describe`, `--json`, `OperationHooks`, `ParamSchema` | **Registry** (`internal/registry/`) |
| References HTTP, retries, `APIError`, status codes, `Get/Post/Patch/Delete` | **Client** (`internal/client/`) |
| References credentials, OAuth, token caching, settings file, `~/.airbyte-agent/` | **Auth** (`internal/auth/`) |
| References `SKILL.md`, `skills/<command>/`, frontmatter | **Skills** (`skills/`) |
| References `--format`, JSON/table output, `--fields`, `writeResult` | **Output** (`internal/output/`) |
| References telemetry, Segment, `CLI Command Executed`, `is_internal_user` | **Telemetry** (`internal/telemetry/`) |
| References OpenAPI specs, `api/*.json`, `extracted_gen.go`, `--describe` payloads | **Schema** (`internal/spec/`, `cmd/extract-schemas/`) |
| References Cobra root, persistent flags, `version`, `login`, entrypoint | **Cmd** (`cmd/`) |
| Spans multiple areas or unclear | **Cross-cutting** (default) |

### Step 2: Spawn Parallel Research Tasks

First, create a unique temp directory for this research session:

```bash
RESEARCH_SESSION_ID=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
RESEARCH_TMP_DIR="thoughts/shared/research/.tmp/session-${RESEARCH_SESSION_ID}"
mkdir -p "$RESEARCH_TMP_DIR"
```

**Always spawn these three core agents in parallel:**

**Agent 1 - Locator (WHERE code lives):**
```
Agent(subagent_type="Explore",
  description="Locate files for [topic]",
  prompt="Find all files related to [topic] in the airbyte-agent CLI.
Look in cmd/, internal/registry/, internal/resources/, internal/client/, internal/auth/,
internal/config/, internal/output/, internal/spec/, internal/telemetry/, skills/, api/.
Return a categorized list: implementation files, test files (*_test.go), generated files
(*_gen.go), skill docs (skills/<cmd>/SKILL.md), OpenAPI specs (api/*.json).
Be thorough — check both the resource Go file and its sibling test file.

IMPORTANT: Write your complete findings to: [RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/locator-findings.md
Use markdown format with file paths and brief descriptions.")
```

**Agent 2 - Analyzer (HOW code works):**
```
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description="Analyze how [topic] works",
  prompt="Analyze how [topic] works in the airbyte-agent CLI.
Read the relevant Go files and trace the code path from main.go through the
registry builder into the operation's Run function (and any PreRun hooks).
Document with file:line references.
Do NOT suggest improvements — only document what exists.

Read AGENTS.md first for the project architecture overview, then dive into the relevant
packages.

IMPORTANT: Write your complete findings to: [RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/analyzer-findings.md
Use markdown format with file:line references.")
```

**Agent 3 - Pattern Finder (similar implementations):**
```
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description="Find patterns matching [topic]",
  prompt="Find existing examples of [pattern type] in the airbyte-agent CLI.
Look at how other resources in internal/resources/ implement the same Resource/Operation
interface — workspaces.go, organizations.go, and connectors.go are good reference points.
Look at how their tests in *_test.go use newTestTokenServer() and newTestClient() helpers.
Return code snippets with file:line references.

IMPORTANT: Write your complete findings to: [RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/patterns-findings.md
Use markdown format with code snippets and file:line references.")
```

**Then spawn a domain-specific 4th agent based on the detected domain:**

#### If Resources or Registry domain:
```
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description="Deep-dive registry architecture",
  prompt="Deep-dive into the resource/registry architecture for [topic].
Focus on:
- Resource interface in internal/registry/types.go (Name(), Description(), Operations())
- Operation struct: Params, Hooks (PreRun for ID resolution), Run function signature
- registry.Builder: how params become Cobra flags, --json vs per-flag mode, --describe behavior
- Param validation order: required check, type check, then hook execution, then Run
- How resources register in internal/resources/register.go
- PreRun resolution pattern (resolveConnectorID, resolveWorkspaceID) — server-side ID lookup
  to prevent path injection

Read AGENTS.md and the relevant files. Document with file:line references.
Do NOT suggest improvements — only document what exists.

IMPORTANT: Write your complete findings to: [RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/domain-findings.md
Use markdown format with file:line references.")
```

#### If Client or Auth domain:
```
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description="Deep-dive HTTP and auth",
  prompt="Deep-dive into the HTTP client and auth layer for [topic].
Focus on:
- internal/client/client.go: Get/Post/Patch/Delete signatures, retry logic
  (3x exponential backoff on 429/502/503/504), 30s timeout, X-ADP-Agent-CLI header
- internal/client/errors.go: APIError struct, ExitCode() mapping (auth=2, not-found=3, validation=4)
- internal/auth/credentials.go: ResolveSettings — env vars first (all three required),
  then ~/.airbyte-agent/settings.json
- internal/auth/credentials_file.go: atomic writes, 0600 permission enforcement
- internal/auth/token.go: TokenManager OAuth caching and auto-refresh

Document with file:line references. Do NOT suggest improvements.

IMPORTANT: Write your complete findings to: [RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/domain-findings.md
Use markdown format with file:line references.")
```

#### If Skills or Schema domain:
```
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description="Deep-dive skills/schema docs",
  prompt="Deep-dive into the [skills | OpenAPI schema] surface for [topic].
For skills: look at skills/<command>/SKILL.md files, their YAML frontmatter
(name/description/command), and the relationship between a skill and its underlying
command in internal/resources/.
For schema: look at how api/*.json is consumed by cmd/extract-schemas/ to generate
internal/spec/extracted_gen.go, and how registry's --describe surfaces the schema at runtime.

Document with file:line references. Do NOT suggest improvements.

IMPORTANT: Write your complete findings to: [RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/domain-findings.md
Use markdown format with file:line references.")
```

#### If Cross-cutting or other domain:
```
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description="Cross-cutting analysis of [topic]",
  prompt="Analyze how [topic] interacts across the airbyte-agent CLI's packages.
Trace the flow from main.go (config -> auth -> client -> registry -> Cobra) through
the relevant packages. Identify which packages collaborate and via what interfaces.

Read AGENTS.md for architecture context. Document with file:line references.
Do NOT suggest improvements — only document what exists.

IMPORTANT: Write your complete findings to: [RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/domain-findings.md
Use markdown format with file:line references.")
```

### Step 3: Synthesize Findings (Incremental)

After ALL sub-tasks complete, synthesize incrementally to avoid context overload:

1. **Read each findings file one at a time:**
   - `[RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/locator-findings.md` → Extract top 10 most relevant files
   - `[RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/analyzer-findings.md` → Extract key architectural insights (5-7 bullets)
   - `[RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/patterns-findings.md` → Extract reusable patterns (3-5 examples)
   - `[RESEARCH_TMP_DIR]/domain-findings.md` → Extract domain-specific insights (5-7 bullets)

2. **Connect findings across components** — note relationships between files/patterns. Every synthesized claim must be grounded in concrete evidence from the findings files (file path and line reference where available).

3. **If synthesis feels overwhelming**, output partial findings and note what needs more review.

### Step 4: Generate Research Document

```bash
mkdir -p thoughts/shared/research
```

Write `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` using this format:

```markdown
# Research: [Topic]

**Date**: [Current date]
**Question**: [Original question]
**Domain**: [Resources | Registry | Client | Auth | Skills | Output | Telemetry | Schema | Cmd | Cross-cutting]

## Provenance

- **Branch HEAD**: `<sha>`
- **origin/main**: `<sha>`
- **Commits behind main**: N

## Summary

[High-level answer to the research question — 2-3 paragraphs]

## Detailed Findings

### [Component/Area 1]
- Description of what exists
- Location: `path/to/file.go:123`
- How it connects to other components

### [Component/Area 2]
...

## Code References

| File | Line | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `internal/resources/connectors.go` | 42 | resolveConnectorID PreRun hook |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Architecture Notes

[Patterns, conventions, and design decisions found — e.g., registry-based command building, PreRun ID resolution, file-input `@filename` syntax]

## Open Questions

[Any areas that need further investigation]
```

### Step 4.5: Cleanup Temp Files (Safe Deletion)

After the research document is successfully written, clean up the temp files:

```bash
if [ -d "$RESEARCH_TMP_DIR" ] && [[ "$RESEARCH_TMP_DIR" == thoughts/shared/research/.tmp/session-* ]]; then
    rm -f "$RESEARCH_TMP_DIR/locator-findings.md"
    rm -f "$RESEARCH_TMP_DIR/analyzer-findings.md"
    rm -f "$RESEARCH_TMP_DIR/patterns-findings.md"
    rm -f "$RESEARCH_TMP_DIR/domain-findings.md"
    rmdir "$RESEARCH_TMP_DIR"
    echo "Temp files cleaned up."
else
    echo "WARNING: Skipping cleanup - unexpected temp directory path: $RESEARCH_TMP_DIR"
fi
```

**Safety guarantees**: only deletes files with names we created, uses `rmdir` (fails if not empty), no wildcards, path validation.

### Step 5: Present Summary

After creating the document, present a concise summary to the user:
- Key findings (3-5 bullet points)
- Most important file references
- Document location for full details
- Ask if they have follow-up questions

## Important Notes

- Always spawn parallel tasks to maximize efficiency
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers
- Research documents should be self-contained
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading
- Document cross-component connections (e.g., a Resource's PreRun → client.Get → output formatter)
- You are a documentarian, not an evaluator
